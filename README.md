# Memorama-Terminal

Simple memory game coded in Python that runs exclusively on the terminal.

The game is able to track RTA time, turn count, and allows a player to continue playing for multiple rounds.

This project was designed as the final project for the Computational  Thinking for Engineering course, during my first semester at university. The course was taught in Spanish,
so all comments and gameplay features are written with Spanish in mind.
