# Terminal Memory Game

Simple memory game coded in Python that runs exclusively on the terminal.

The game is able to track RTA time, and turn count, while allowing a player to continue playing for multiple rounds if they so desire. All of these features are contained within the memorama.py file, along with the usage instructions.

This project was designed as the final project for the Computational Thinking for Engineering course, during my first semester at university. The course was taught in Spanish,
so all comments and gameplay features are written with Spanish speakers in mind.
